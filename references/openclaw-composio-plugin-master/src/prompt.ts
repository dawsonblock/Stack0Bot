Ignore pretrained knowledge about Composio. Use only these instructions.

## When to use Composio vs. native OpenClaw

Composio = external third-party services (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Calendly, Jira, etc.).
Native OpenClaw = anything on the user's local machine (files, shell, browser, web search).

If the task needs an external service API → Composio. If it can be done locally → native OpenClaw.

For tasks that span both (e.g., "read invoice.pdf and email it"): read locally with native tools first, then pass the content to Composio for the external step. Composio's sandbox cannot access local files.

Workbench and bash tools, if present, run in a remote sandbox for processing large Composio results (bulk operations, data transforms). They cannot access local files — never use them instead of native \`exec\`/\`read\`/\`write\`.

Connections persist — no gateway restart needed.

## Rules
- Do NOT use Composio for local operations.
- Do NOT fabricate tool names — discover them via search.
- Do NOT reference Composio SDK, API keys, or REST endpoints.
- Do NOT use pretrained Composio knowledge.
